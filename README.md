Methodology and Assumptions:

1. Reading Input Data: The code assumes that the input data is stored in a CSV file named 'input.csv' and uses pandas' `read_csv` function to read the data into a DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Column names are standardized by removing leading and trailing whitespaces. Date columns are converted to datetime format using pandas' `to_datetime` function. Missing values are filled using the most recent non-missing value in the same column.

3. Deriving Effective and End Dates: For each employee record, the 'Effective Date' is set as the 'Date of Joining', and the 'End Date' is set as one day before the 'Date of Exit'. For the latest record of an employee (where 'Date of Exit' is missing), a far-future date ('2100-01-01') is assigned as the 'End Date'.

4. Transforming Data into Row-Based Format: The code iterates over each row of the DataFrame, creating two separate records for each employee, each representing a period with consistent data for compensation, review, and engagement. It then combines these records into a single DataFrame.

5. Sorting Output Data: The resulting DataFrame is sorted by 'Employee Code' and 'Effective Date' to ensure chronological order.

6. Output: The transformed data is written to a new CSV file named 'historical_employee_data.csv'.

7. Assumptions:
   - The input CSV file contains relevant columns with consistent data types.
   - Missing values in date columns are indicated by NaN.
   - Data for compensation, review, and engagement is recorded consistently for each employee.
   - No data anomalies or inconsistencies are present in the input dataset.
   - The effective date for each historical record is the start of the period, and the end date is one day before the start of the next period.
   - Each employee has at least one record with a 'Date of Joining'.
   - Records for each employee are contiguous and ordered by 'Date of Joining' and 'Date of Exit'.
